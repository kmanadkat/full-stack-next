## ðŸš€ Full Stack Ecommerce Project

This is a learning full stack ecommerce project. The goal of this is to learn new full stack technology besides the most commonly known MERN or MEAN stacks. Following frameworks are used:

#### `Frontend`

1. Next Js
2. Styled Components
3. Framer Motion

#### `Backend`

1. Postgres DB
2. GraphQL & Strapi Headless CMS
3. Auth0 For Authentication & Authorization
4. Cloudinary (Image Assets Optimizations)
5. Stripes Payment Gateway

### Prerequisites

- Node v14.x 
- npm v8.x
- yarn v1.22.x

> I mostly use `yarn` to install packages because `npm` breaks sometimes during dependency resolution, read more [here](https://overreacted.io/npm-audit-broken-by-design/)

### Install
